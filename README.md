As seen from the analysis summary DataFrame above, the total number of rides taken in Urban cities is twice that of the combined total of Rural and Suburban cities while having nearly 5 times the driver count. The average fare per ride, and per driver is highest for Rural, then Suburban and least for Urban cities. However, the total fares for Urban cities is significantly higher than that of Suburban and Rural cities
